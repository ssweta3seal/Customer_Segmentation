In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

The need of customer segmentation:- The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:
Target Marketing.Client understanding,Optimal product placement, Revenue growth

1. Segmentation allows businesses to make better use of their marketing budgets, gain a competitive edge over rival companies and demonstrate better knowledge of their customer's needs and wants.
2. Implemented Clustering using K-means to identify three customer segments on data to optimize the impact of marketing campaigns. 
3. Tried DBscan agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cluster the contents and
used the elbow method and silhouette score for evaluation. Used RFM modeling
4. The same approach can be utilized for e-commerce, Healthcare for grouping the
customers depending on their similarities and personalized deals can be offered.

Conclusions:
1. Descriptive Analysis: The data exploration of Online customer segmentation dataset shows :
2. Missing and duplicate values were found.
3. Most of the purchases are from the United Kingdom.
4. Most of the customers have purchased items in November, October, December, and the least number of purchases in April, January, February.
5. Most of the customers purchase in the afternoon time.
6.Using a recency, frequency and monetary(RFM) analysis, the customers have been segmented into various clusters.
7. By applying different clustering algorithm to our dataset, we get the optimal number of cluster is equal to 3.
8. The business can focus on these different clusters and provide customer with services of each sector in a different way, which would not only benefit the customers but also the business at large.
